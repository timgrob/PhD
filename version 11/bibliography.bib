  Abstract                 = {A model is presented for predicting the magnetic field, and the magnetic and fluidic forces on micro/nano-particles in a magnetophoretic microsystem. The microsystem consists of a linear array of soft-magnetic elements embedded beneath a microfluidic channel. The magnetic elements are magnetized using an external bias field, and produce a nonuniform field distribution that permeates the microchannel. This gives rise to a magnetic force on particles as they flow through the microsystem. Analytical expressions are derived for the field distribution within the microchannel, and the magnetic force on the particles. A linear magnetization model is used to predict the magnetic response of the particles, and the magnetic field and force expressions are verified using finite element analysis. The particles also experience a fluidic force, which is predicted using Stokes' law for the drag on a sphere in laminar flow. The model presented here includes magnetic and fluidic analysis, and enables rapid predictions of the field and force throughout the microsystem as a function of key variables including the particle size and properties, the properties and spacing of the magnetic elements, the bias field source, the dimensions of the microchannel, the fluid properties, and the flow rate. The model is well-suited for parametric analysis, and is demonstrated via practical calculations.},

  Abstract                 = {A study is presented of coupled particlefluid transport and field-directed particle capture in microfluidic systems with passive magnetic functionality. These systems consist of a microfluidic flow cell on a substrate that contains embedded magnetic elements. Two systems are considered that utilize soft- and hard-magnetic elements, respectively. In the former, an external field is applied to magnetize the elements, and in the latter, they are permanently magnetized. The field produced by the magnetized elements permeates into the flow cell giving rise to an attractive force on magnetic particles that flow through it. The systems are studied using a novel numerical/closed-form modelling approach that combines numerical transport analysis with closed-form field analysis. Particlefluid transport is computed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), while the magnetic force that governs particle capture is obtained in closed form. The CFD analysis takes into account dominant particle forces and two-way momentum transfer between the particles and the fluid. The two-way particlefluid coupling capability is an important feature of the model that distinguishes it from more commonly used and simplified one-way coupling analysis. The model is used to quantify the impact of two-way particlefluid coupling on both the capture efficiency and the flow pattern in the systems considered. Many effects such as particle-induced flow-enhanced capture efficiency and flow circulation are studied that cannot be predicted using one-way coupling analysis. In addition, dilute particle dispersions are shown to exhibit significant localized particlefluid coupling near the capture regions, which contradicts the commonly held view that two-way coupling can be ignored when analysing high-gradient magnetic separation involving such particle systems. Overall, the model demonstrates that two-way coupling needs to be taken into account for rigorous predictions of capture efficiency, especially for applications involving high particle loading and/or low flow rates. It is computationally more efficient and accurate than purely numerical models and should prove useful for the rational design and optimization of novel magnetophoretic microsystems.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyse three different a posteriori error estimators for elliptic partial differential equations. They are based on the evaluation of local residuals with respect to the strong form of the differential equation, on the solution of local problems with Neumann boundary conditions, and on the solution of local problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We prove that all three are equivalent and yield global upper and local lower bounds for the true error. Thus adaptive mesh-refinement techniques based on these estimators are capable to detect local singularities of the solution and to appropriately refine the grid near these singularities. Some numerical examples prove the efficiency of the error estimators and the mesh-refinement techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel approach for extracting living cells genomic \{DNA\} materials utilizing functionalized magnetic particles (MPs) is reported in this investigation. This strategy is amenable to handle bio-samples in a miniaturized environment and it offers a possibility to separate and purify \{DNA\} from other cell lysate mixtures on-chip?, which is known to be a bottle-neck step in an integrated micro-total-analysis-system (TAS). Species-specific? genomic \{DNA\} of interest is captured by the \{MPs\} based on the hybridization interaction between the biotinylated probes modified \{MPs\} and a complementary region of the targeted genome. The genome \{DNA\} anchored on the particles can be separated from the rest of cellular mixtures by a simple buffer washing upon the exertion of external magnetic force. Surface modifications of \{MPs\} and hybridization conditions affecting the genome capturing efficiency are investigated. Extraction of genomic \{DNA\} from E. coli is demonstrated in a silicon/glass-based micro-reactor patterned with a platinum heater and sensors. On-chip extraction and manipulation of genomic \{DNAs\} illustrated in this study is a step forward toward a total integrated bioanalytical microsystem for crude cells/sample analysis. },

RECENT FINDINGS: The definitions of the terms discussed in this article--medical signs, symptoms, biomarkers, surrogate endpoints, clinical endpoints, validation--are still under discussion, as are their relationships to each other, but broad consensus has developed in the past decade and a half about the necessity of distinguishing between, in particular, surrogate and clinical endpoints. SUMMARY: This article outlines the major definitions of the key terms in this field and considers select cases where misunderstandings about the terms led to flawed research conclusions.},
